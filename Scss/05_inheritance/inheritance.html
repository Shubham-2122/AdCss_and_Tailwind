    <p>Extend/Inheritance</p>
    <p>Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. In our example weâ€™re going to
        create a simple series of messaging for errors, warnings and successes using another feature which goes hand in
        hand with extend, placeholder classes. A placeholder class is a special type of class that only prints when it
        is extended, and can help keep your compiled CSS neat and clean.</p>
